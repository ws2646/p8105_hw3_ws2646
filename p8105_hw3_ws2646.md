### Short discription of the dataset

This dataset contains 1384617 rows of observations and 15 columns of
variables. The structure is, each row represents one order of one
product by one user from an online grocery store “Instacart”.

The 15 variables are order\_id, product\_id, add\_to\_cart\_order,
reordered, user\_id, eval\_set, order\_number, order\_dow,
order\_hour\_of\_day, days\_since\_prior\_order, product\_name,
aisle\_id, department\_id, aisle, department .

### Describing some key variables

``` r
mean(pull(instacart, reordered))
```

    ## [1] 0.5985944

``` r
names(sort(table(pull(instacart, order_hour_of_day)), decreasing = TRUE))[1]
```

    ## [1] "14"

``` r
mean(pull(instacart, days_since_prior_order))
```

    ## [1] 17.06613

``` r
names(sort(table(pull(instacart, product_name)), decreasing = TRUE))[1]
```

    ## [1] "Banana"

I found there are 4 variables are important.

The first one is `reordered`, which represents if the order has been
ordered or not.

The mean of `reordered` is 0.5985944, which means about 59.86% of the
orders has been reordered.

The second one is `order_hour_of_day`, which shows the hour of a day
when a user placed that order.

Most of the users placed order in 14, which is 2 pm.

The third one is `days_since_prior_order`, which means after how many
days the users placed another order.

The mean of `days_since_prior_order` is 17.06613, which means users
often placed another order after about 17 days.

The fourth one is `product_name`, which shows the name of a product.

Banana has been the most product the users ordered.

### Example of observation

``` r
instacart[10,] %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| order\_id | product\_id | add\_to\_cart\_order | reordered | user\_id | eval\_set | order\_number | order\_dow | order\_hour\_of\_day | days\_since\_prior\_order | product\_name | aisle\_id | department\_id | aisle                         | department |
|----------:|------------:|---------------------:|----------:|---------:|:----------|--------------:|-----------:|---------------------:|--------------------------:|:--------------|----------:|---------------:|:------------------------------|:-----------|
|        36 |       19660 |                    2 |         1 |    79431 | train     |            23 |          6 |                   18 |                        30 | Spring Water  |       115 |              7 | water seltzer sparkling water | beverages  |

I chose the 10th row from this dataset. It shows that this user ordered
Spring Water from aisle “water seltzer sparkling water” at aisle 115
from department beverages. This user placed this order at 6 pm on
Saturday, and it has been 30 days since this user’s last order.

### About aisles

``` r
length(unique(pull(instacart, aisle)))
```

    ## [1] 134

``` r
names(sort(table(pull(instacart, aisle)), decreasing = TRUE)) [1]
```

    ## [1] "fresh vegetables"

There are 134 unique aisles, of which fresh vegetables was the most
ordered item from.

``` r
aisle_plot = 
  instacart %>% 
  count(aisle, name = "number_of_items") %>% 
  filter(number_of_items > 10000)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(reorder(aisle, number_of_items), x = number_of_items)) +
  geom_point()+
  labs(
    title = "Number of items (more than 10,000 times) ordered in each aisle",
    x = "Number of items",
    y = "Aisle name",
    caption = "Data from p8105 website"
  )

### Popular items in aisles

``` r
three_pop_items_df = 
  instacart %>% 
  select(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients" | aisle == "dog food care" | aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>%

  summarize(order_times = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(order_times)) %>%
  mutate(product_rank = min_rank(desc(order_times))) %>% 
  filter(product_rank <= 3)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

### Mean order hour of items

``` r
hour_df = 
  instacart %>% 
  select(order_dow, order_hour_of_day, product_name) %>% 
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>% 
  group_by(order_dow, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "order_dow",
    values_from = "mean_hour"
  ) %>% 
  rename("Sunday" = "0", "Monday" = "1", "Tuesday" = "2", "Wednesday" = "3", "Thursday" = "4",
         "Friday" = "5", "Saturday" = "6") 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'order_dow'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
knitr::kable(hour_df)
```

| product\_name    |   Sunday |   Monday |  Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday |   Friday | Saturday |
|:-----------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 |  15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |

This is the table showing the mean order hour of a day at which Pink
Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week.
From this table, we can see that in general Pink Lady Apples is ordered
earlier in a day than Coffee Ice Cream.
